# Balking design pattern

- The balking pattern is a software design pattern that only executes an action on an object when the object is in a particular state.
- Objects that use this pattern are generally only in a state that is prone to balking temporarily but for an unknown amount of time.
- If an objectâ€™s method is invoked when the object is in an inappropriate state, then the method will return without doing anything.
